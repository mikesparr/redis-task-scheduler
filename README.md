# Redis Task Scheduler
This module schedules tasks that will be run 
with https://github.com/mikesparr/redis-docker-taskrunner

# Requirements
Redis must be installed and running, or accessible via network.

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION
This is incomplete but I'm refactoring some class dependencies for the runner project and need to publish this first.

# Install
```bash
npm install redis-task-scheduler
yarn add redis-task-scheduler
```

# Test
Tests are in `src/__tests__` and `src/lib/__tests__` respectively. The app is built in 
Typescript but compiles to `.js` files.

```bash
npm test
npm run coverage # optional
```

# Usage
## Quick start (node)
```javascript
// pending
```

## Typescript
```typescript
// pending
```

# Contributing
I haven't thought that far ahead. I needed this for my own project and decided to give back.
